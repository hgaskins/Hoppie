The purpose of this project is to create a web app for beer consumers and connoisseurs alike.

A user would want to access the site and be able to find local breweries around them, and find out information
about different types of beers. The app will also include information to calculate BAC and if it is a high number, provide
links to UBER and Lyft apps.

## Stories

- as a developer I want to use FP, OOP, middleware, SMACCS, and DRY principles.
- as a developer I want to use the appropriate APIs, and data to display quality information to my users.
-  as a user I want to find information about beer and have interactivity including a BAC with links to driving services so I can get home safely.
