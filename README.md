The purpose of this project is to create a web app for beer consumers and connoisseurs alike. 

A user would want to access the site and be able to find local breweries around them, and find out information 
about different types of beers. The app will also include information to calculate BAC and if it is a high number, provide 
links to UBER and Lyft apps.
